<context>
Phase 1 of the GSP project diamond. Scopes the project by determining what screens and components are needed, what adaptations the brand system requires for this specific project, and performs gap analysis against the codebase.

Encourages treating the project as a bounded issue (or set of issues) and a PR — ship small, ship complete.

Works with the dual-diamond architecture: reads brand system from `.design/branding/{brand}/patterns/` via `brand.ref`, reads/writes project assets in `.design/projects/{project}/`.
</context>

<objective>
Scope the project and plan adaptations from the brand system.

**Input:** Brand system (via brand.ref) + project BRIEF.md + config.json
**Output:** `{project}/brief/` (scope.md, target-adaptations.md, conditionals, INDEX.md)
</objective>

<execution_context>
@${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../templates/phases/brief.md

## Step 0: Resolve project and brand

Resolve project from `.design/projects/` (one → use it, multiple → ask). Set `PROJECT_PATH`.

Read `{PROJECT_PATH}/brand.ref` → set `BRAND_PATH`. If brand.ref doesn't exist, tell the user to run `/gsp-start`.

## Step 1: Load context

### Brand patterns (chunk-first)

Read `{BRAND_PATH}/patterns/INDEX.md`. If it exists, load all foundation chunks + selective component chunks.

If it doesn't exist, tell the user to run `/gsp-brand-guidelines` first to create the brand's design patterns.

Also read the brand `.yml` preset from `{BRAND_PATH}/patterns/`.

### Project context

Read:
- `{PROJECT_PATH}/BRIEF.md` — what we're building, platforms, tech stack
- `{PROJECT_PATH}/config.json` — get `implementation_target`, `design_scope`, `codebase_type`

### Codebase context

Read `.design/system/STACK.md` and `.design/system/COMPONENTS.md` (if exist) — existing tech stack, components, architecture.

Read `.design/CHANGELOG.md` — quick history of what prior projects built.
For projects with overlapping scope, read their `codebase/MANIFEST.md` for detail.
Glob `.design/projects/*/STATE.md` — detect active sibling projects.

## Step 1.5: Scope check

**If `design_scope` is `tokens`:**
1. Update `{PROJECT_PATH}/STATE.md` — set Phase 1 (Brief) status to `skipped`
2. Display: "Brief phase skipped — design scope is `tokens`."
3. Route: "Run `/gsp-project-build`."
4. Stop here.

## Step 1.7: Issue framing

Suggest to the user:
"Consider framing this project as a bounded issue (or set of issues) and a PR. Smaller scope = higher quality. What's the tightest version of this that ships?"

If the project scope feels large, suggest breaking it into multiple bounded issues — each one a focused deliverable that can be reviewed independently.

## Step 2: Scope the project

Using all context loaded in Step 1, scope the project directly. Act as a Senior Design Project Lead bridging the brand system and the project's specific needs.

If any sibling project is active and its scope overlaps with this project, flag it: "⚠️ {name} is actively working on {scope}. Coordinate to avoid conflicts."
If this project modifies components from a sibling's manifest, note provenance.

### Scoping process

1. **Analyze brief** — what's being built, for whom, on what platforms
2. **Define screen list** — prioritized screens from brief, user flows, success criteria
3. **Map component scope** — which brand system components this project needs
4. **Identify adaptations** — project-specific variants, overrides, or extensions to brand components
5. **Map to implementation target** — connect design components to target primitives (shadcn, rn-reusables, existing, code)
6. **Gap analysis** (existing codebases) — what's in the brand system but missing from the codebase
7. **Generate install manifest** (shadcn/rn-reusables) — install commands for needed components
8. **Issue framing** — suggest how to break the project into bounded, shippable issues

### Quality standards

- Every screen has a clear purpose and priority level
- Component adaptations reference specific brand system components
- Gap analysis is concrete (component names, token names)
- Install manifests are copy-paste ready
- Scope boundaries are explicit (what's in, what's out)

### Write chunks to `{PROJECT_PATH}/brief/`

Use the brief output template from execution_context for chunk formatting.

1. **`scope.md`** (~80-120 lines) — prioritized screen list, component scope, project boundaries, success criteria, dependencies, issue framing
2. **`target-adaptations.md`** (~60-100 lines) — token overrides, component adaptations, platform considerations, implementation target mapping
3. **`install-manifest.md`** (shadcn/rn-reusables only) — install commands for all needed components
4. **`gap-analysis.md`** (existing target only) — components/tokens in brand system but not in codebase
5. **`file-references.md`** (existing target only) — paths to existing components/tokens being used

Cross-references: `target-adaptations.md` links to `{BRAND_PATH}/patterns/components/{name}.md`; `gap-analysis.md` links to brand system components and tokens; `scope.md` references the project BRIEF.md.

### Write `INDEX.md`

```markdown
# Brief
> Phase: brief | Project: {name} | Generated: {DATE}

## Scoping

| Chunk | File | ~Lines |
|-------|------|--------|
| Scope | [scope.md](./scope.md) | ~{N} |
| Target Adaptations | [target-adaptations.md](./target-adaptations.md) | ~{N} |
| Install Manifest | [install-manifest.md](./install-manifest.md) | ~{N} |
| Gap Analysis | [gap-analysis.md](./gap-analysis.md) | ~{N} |
| File References | [file-references.md](./file-references.md) | ~{N} |
```

Only include rows for chunks that were actually produced.

## Step 3: Write exports

Update `{PROJECT_PATH}/exports/INDEX.md`:
- If INDEX.md doesn't exist, copy it from `templates/exports-index.md`
- Replace everything between `<!-- BEGIN:brief -->` and `<!-- END:brief -->` with populated table:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN:brief -->
| Section | File |
|---------|------|
| Scope | [scope.md](../brief/scope.md) |
| Target Adaptations | [target-adaptations.md](../brief/target-adaptations.md) |
| Install Manifest | [install-manifest.md](../brief/install-manifest.md) |
| Gap Analysis | [gap-analysis.md](../brief/gap-analysis.md) |
| File References | [file-references.md](../brief/file-references.md) |
<!-- END:brief -->
```

Only include rows for chunks that were actually produced.

## Step 4: Update state

Update `{PROJECT_PATH}/STATE.md`:
- Set Phase 1 (Brief) status to `complete`
- Record completion date

## Step 5: Phase transition output

Invoke `/gsp-phase-transition` with phase `brief` and output directory `{PROJECT_PATH}/brief/`.
</process>
</output>
