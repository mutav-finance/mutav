<context>
Phase 0 of the GSP branding diamond. Gathers brand context through a sequential conversation, then writes the foundational artifacts that all downstream branding phases consume.

Works two ways:
1. **Routed** — `/gsp-start` detects "new brand" intent and invokes this skill
2. **Direct** — user runs `/gsp-brand-brief` directly

This skill handles **new brands only**. For existing brands (evolve mode), `/gsp-start` routes to `/gsp-brand-audit` directly.
</context>

<objective>
Through a sequential one-question-at-a-time conversation, gather brand context and write foundational artifacts.

**Input:** Brand name (from args or asked)
**Output:** `.design/branding/{name}/` with BRIEF.md, STATE.md, config.json, ROADMAP.md
**Next:** `/gsp-brand-research`
</objective>

<rules>
- Always use `AskUserQuestion` for user-facing questions — never raw text prompts.
- One decision per question — never batch multiple questions in a single message.
- Never infer the user's name from package metadata, git config, or file paths — those are authors, not the current user.
</rules>

<questioning_principles>
**One decision per question.** Every question must be its own `AskUserQuestion` call. Ask one thing, wait for the answer, use it to inform the next question.

**Never re-ask what the user already answered.** If you need to validate, confirm: "I see X from earlier — still accurate?"

**Inference over interrogation.** Don't ask what you can infer. "Fintech for Gen Z" → mobile-first, modern, trustworthy. State inferences, let them correct.

**Concrete options over open-ended.** "More like Stripe's clean approach or Duolingo's playful style?" beats "What style do you want?" Use `AskUserQuestion` with 2-3 options when the option space is known.

**Adapt and skip.** If an early answer reveals enough, skip later questions. Follow up on surprises before moving on. The sequence is a guide, not a script.

**Know when you have enough.** A brand brief is complete when you can answer:
- [ ] Who is this for and what do they need?
- [ ] What does the brand feel like?
- [ ] What are the hard constraints?
</questioning_principles>

<process>
## Step 1: Resolve context and create structure

Check if a brand name was passed via invocation args. If not, ask:

1. Ask for brand name (kebab-case, e.g., "acme-corp") — `AskUserQuestion`

Validate: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only. Check `.design/branding/{name}/` doesn't already exist. If it does, use `AskUserQuestion`: **Overwrite** / **Pick a different name**.

Accept an optional `e2e` flag from the invoking skill. Default to `false`.

Create directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p .design/branding/{name}/{discover,strategy,identity,patterns}
```

## Step 2: Business & People

Sequential `AskUserQuestion` calls. Ask one, wait, adapt, ask the next. Skip anything you can already infer.

2. What's the company name, and what industry/stage? (open-ended `AskUserQuestion`)
3. What problem does it solve, and for whom? (open-ended — use the answer to start inferring persona)
4. What's the business model? (use `AskUserQuestion` with options if you can infer likely models from industry, otherwise open-ended)
5. Who are the main competitors? (2-3 names — open-ended)
6. Present an inferred primary persona — a concrete profile (name, role, frustration, aspiration) based on answers so far. Personas should feel like real people — dig into the emotional layer. Use `AskUserQuestion`: **Looks right** / **Adjust** / **Add a secondary persona**

## Step 3: Brand Essence

Before presenting personality options, **internally synthesize** promise (what should someone feel?) and point of view (what does this brand disagree with?) from prior answers. Don't ask these directly — use them to ground personality options.

7. Brand personality direction — use `AskUserQuestion` with 2-3 concrete personality directions. **Each option must explain WHY it fits this brand's audience and problem** — not just a style label:
    - Each option: **Label** (3 adjectives) / **Description** (why this personality fits their specific audience and competitive position — reference the persona by name, the problem, or the gap) / **Preview** (example sentence in that voice, using their product context)
    - **Surprise me** — craft an unexpected direction inspired by the user's industry and personas
    - Note: this is a high-level direction only. Brand strategy phase will deepen this into archetype + voice — don't over-refine here.
8. What should the brand NEVER feel like? (use `AskUserQuestion` with 2-3 anti-directions inferred from their personality pick, plus open-ended option)
9. Brands admired or styles to avoid? (open-ended `AskUserQuestion`)

## Step 4: Constraints & confirmation

10. Any non-negotiables or constraints? (timeline, budget, must-haves) — open-ended `AskUserQuestion`
11. State your understanding back: "Here's what I'm hearing: [summary]." Use `AskUserQuestion`:
    - **Looks good** — "That's accurate, let's go"
    - **Adjust something** — "I want to change or add something"

If "Adjust" — ask what to change, update your understanding, re-confirm. Don't re-ask everything.

## Step 5: Write artifacts

Read templates at write time from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../templates/branding/` and write:

1. `.design/branding/{name}/BRIEF.md` from `brief.md` template
   - Populate all sections from conversation answers
   - Synthesize brand promise, POV, and personality (these are inferred, not asked directly)
   - Set `brand_mode` to `new`
   - Set evolve-only sections (Existing Brand State, Evolution Scope) to "N/A — new brand"

2. `.design/branding/{name}/STATE.md` from `state.md` template
   - Phase 0 (Audit): `skipped`
   - All other phases: `pending`

3. `.design/branding/{name}/config.json` from `config.json` template
   - Set `brand.name`, `brand.created` (ISO date)
   - Set `brand_mode: "new"`
   - Set `e2e` flag from Step 1

4. `.design/branding/{name}/ROADMAP.md` from `roadmap.md` template

## Step 6: Route

Use `AskUserQuestion` — always offer Continue / Stop here / What happens next:

- **Continue to research** — "Start market and competitor research" → invoke `/gsp-brand-research` via Skill tool
- **Stop here** — "I'll come back later" → confirm files are saved, show how to resume with `/gsp-start`
- **What happens next?** — "Explain the research phase" → explain what brand-research does (market landscape, competitive audit, trend analysis, mood board direction) and how it uses the brief

If `e2e: true`, mention that after the full branding diamond completes, it will auto-transition to project setup.
